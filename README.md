## About <a name = "about"></a>

Many developer needs to develop forms for their web application and they spend lots of precious hours on developing such forms.

Forms may contains input fields, select fields, textareas etc. Sometime developer has to inject another jquery plugins to attach datepickers, select2, datatables, validations etc. 

This waste to much time of developer to develop one single form in html.

I personally develop this jquery plugin to reduce such headache of writing to much html code to develop forms.

Follow the guidline to develop predesign bootstrap 4 form by only json configuration.
